long_text: Do you play Minecraft at night? Are you scared of opening your inventory, because it blinds you immediately? Well this addon is for you! Not only does it make the GUI darker, it also redesigns the main menu with a new panorama and some custom white splashes that blend well with the whole look of the addon! Direct download soon, for now download the addon from Planet Minecraft
